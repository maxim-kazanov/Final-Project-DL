# Problem Statement

**Image captioning**

Image captioning is crucial because it bridges the gap between visual data and human language, allowing machines to understand and describe the content of an image.

It's importance lies in key applications:

- Accessibility: Providing alt-text descriptions for the visually impaired.

- Search & Indexing: Improving the ability of search engines to find images based on their semantic content.

- Robotics: Providing necessary situational awareness for autonomous systems.

**The Flickr8k Dataset**

The Flickr8k Dataset is a foundational benchmark for image captioning models.

- Content: 8,000 images, specifically chosen to show human actions and interactions.

- Annotations: Each image is paired with five distinct human-generated captions, totaling 40,000 captions.

- Purpose: It is used to train and evaluate Encoder-Decoder models (like the CNN-Transformer hybrid) that generate natural language descriptions from visual input.
